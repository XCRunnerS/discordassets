```txt
Hard Ban: a ban with no appeal, where any accounts associated with the user will also be banned with no appeal.

```

_Why are these rules becoming more strict?_

- Personal respect is significantly more important, and content regarding cheating in public servers, edgy content, and other such content isnt productive, and can lead to negative situations for many users. I would prefer to make the rules more strict in a way I have more control over, while still giving freedom to post content.
